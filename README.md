# NetworkLib

NetworkLib is a simple, yet powerful library to allow developers of all skill levels create games and more quicker and easier.

Most of the original code/features come from Cove Network (Legacy MC) my old Minecraft network.

It's still currently in very early development, and it may be for a while (or forever). Please do not run this on a public server.
